Doctor: Good morning. What brings you in today?

Patient: Hi doctor. I've been having this persistent headache for about three days now. It's mostly on the right side of my head.

Doctor: I see. Can you describe the pain? Is it throbbing, sharp, or more of a dull ache?

Patient: It's more of a throbbing pain. It gets worse when I'm in bright light or loud environments.

Doctor: Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with the headache?

Patient: Yes, I felt nauseous yesterday but didn't actually vomit.

Doctor: Any visual disturbances? Like seeing spots or flashing lights?

Patient: Now that you mention it, I did see some flickering lights before the headache started.

Doctor: Based on what you're describing, this sounds like it could be a migraine. Have you had migraines before?

Patient: My mother gets them, but I've never had one this bad.

Doctor: That family history is relevant. I'm going to recommend some lifestyle modifications and prescribe sumatriptan for acute relief. Take it at the onset of symptoms. I also want you to keep a headache diary to identify triggers.

Patient: Okay, thank you doctor. Should I be worried about anything serious?

Doctor: Given your symptoms and family history, I'm confident this is migraine. However, if you experience sudden severe headache, neck stiffness, or fever, please come back immediately or go to emergency.
